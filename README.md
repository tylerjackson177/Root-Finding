# Root Finding Methods in Python

This project implements various root-finding algorithms to solve mathematical equations. The methods include the **Secant Method**, **Bisection Method**, **False Position Method**, and **Newton's Method**. Results are visualized using graphs.

---

## Features
1. **Secant Method**:
   - Applied to three equations with initial guesses \(x_0 = 1\) and \(x_1 = 2\).
   - Default relative error criterion: \(1 \times 10^{-7}\).
   - Maximum iterations: 30.
   - Graphs display the function and roots.

2. **Bisection Method and False Position Method**:
   - Applied to two equations with initial bounds \(x_l = 0\) and \(x_u = 2\).
   - Default relative error criterion: \(0.1\).
   - Maximum iterations: 20.
   - Combined graph displays both methods with roots.

3. **Newton's Method**:
   - Applied to one equation with an initial guess of \(x_0 = 0.3\).
   - Default relative error criterion: \(1 \times 10^{-7}\).
   - Maximum iterations: 30.
   - Graph displays the function and root.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the Python file.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib) installed.
3. Run the Python file:
   ```bash
   python LastName_FirstName_RootFinding.py
   ```
4. View the output and graphs generated by the program.

---

## Output Format
- **Solution**: The approximate root.
- **Function Value**: Function value at the solution.
- **Relative Error**: The relative error at convergence.
- **Number of Iterations**: The iterations taken to converge.

Example:
```
The (Method Name) Solution is as follows:
Solution = 3.0467
Function value at solution = 9.61009e-13
Relative error = 1.822e-07
Number of iterations = 5
```

---

## Graph Requirements
- Three graphs for the entire project:
  1. One graph for the Secant Method solutions.
  2. One graph combining the Bisection and False Position Methods.
  3. One graph for Newton's Method.

- Graph titles must include the last name of the author and the method(s).

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for implementation.
- **NumPy** for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** for graphing.

---

## Notes
- All outputs and graphs are generated from a single Python file.
- The graphing methods should clearly visualize the roots for each function.
- Ensure proper labeling of graphs and outputs for clarity.
